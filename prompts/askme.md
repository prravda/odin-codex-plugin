# Ask Me Command

Before proceeding to ask planning questions, you must *proactively and critically* execute both Verbalized Sampling (VS) and exploration:

- For Verbalized Sampling, generate and *sample* multiple (at least 5) distinct, diverse candidates that represent different possible user intents or directions, ranked by likelihood. Critically assess each VS sample: point out potential weaknesses, contradictions, or oversights. VS prevents over-engineering by surfacing simpler alternatives.

**Required VS Output Format:**
```
1. [Most likely] hypothesis here
   - Weakness: [potential flaw]
   - Contradiction: [logical conflict if any]
   - Oversight: [what this misses]

2. [Alternative] hypothesis here
   ...
```

- For exploration, deliberately seek out unconventional, underexplored, and edge-case possibilities relating to the user's objective, drawing on both the provided context and plausible but non-obvious requirements.

Only after completing *both* critical VS and exploration steps, proceed to use the question tool to ask the *maximum possible number* of precise, clarifying, and challenging planning questions that holistically address the problem space, taking into account uncertainty, gaps, and ambiguous requirements.
